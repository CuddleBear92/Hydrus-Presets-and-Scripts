[See the help files for how to add downloaders to Hydrus](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/help/adding_new_downloaders.html)

This downloader pulls images at their original size directly from Baraag.

You might get away with running this without cookies / logging in but it's
likely you'll get rate limited unless you import your session cookies to Hydrus.
Even if you're properly authenticated, it's likely Baraag will still rate limit
you after a while. Hydrus _should_ handle this smoothly and back off when rate
limited.

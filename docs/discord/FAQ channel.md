__**GENERAL**__
> ***What is Hydrus?***
> It's a file manager and downloader based on hash values and tags.
> It allows for easy management of tags for almost any file, primarily images.
> But is made for file from the online web, like a booru or imageboard.
> 
> ***My antivirus says this is bad! Is it!?***
> It's a false positive caused by:
> a) some viruses out there using -as an example- the same Python libraries for network access as Hydrus does, causing anti-virus programs to react to Hydrus as if it was a virus or:
> b) the antivirus testing doing really weird things with Hydrus and thinking it's a virus because of their own stupidity.
> If you trust Hydrus just tell your anti-virus to allow it and disable scanning on the Hydrus install folder.
> If you don't trust Hydrus stop using it.
> Either way the source code is open for scrutiny.

> Login scripts: Navigate to `network > logins` and add your login details to the site in question if one exists. If a login script doesn't exist you may create one yourself (advanced).
